# Hot Sauce Exercise

## Purpose
This exercise is provided as a less stressful and more realistic alternative to whiteboard exercises. We understand that you have other commitments and don’t expect this to take more than a few hours to complete. It should be somewhat enjoyable, or at least more so than studying up on binary trees and sorting algorithms. It is not a test, but rather a starting point for discussion in the interview.

## Specification
You’ll be building an application for browsing hot sauces. The first page is a grid of hot sauces, with an image, title, and subtitle for each. Upon clicking one of these, the user will be taken to a detail page, where a larger image and in-depth description of the sauce is provided. A link is provided to go back to the grid page to select another hot sauce. Each grid item also contains a small delete button in the corner, which will remove it from the grid. There’s no need to update the data source.

Alongside these instructions you’ll find two wireframes which correspond to these pages. The wireframes are intentionally rough, so don’t worry about matching the design pixel-for-pixel and feel free to improve on it. A JSON file of hot sauces is provided to serve as a data source for your application.

While on a real project you’d have access to designers and program managers to clarify the requirements, for this exercise you may have to make some assumptions. Please note anything that was unclear so that we can improve this exercise in the future.

## Optional enhancements
Here are some ideas if you would like to go beyond the specification. We welcome any or all of these, but encourage you not to feel obligated to do them.

* Enhancing the functionality or behavior
* Add routing for sauce URLs
* Enable adding a sauce (title, description, image, etc.)
* Improving the design
* Make the pages responsive
* Animations, transitions, etc.

## Requirements
Your web application must use:
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* The provided JSON file as a data source
* Custom-built components (no libraries like Bootstrap)
* A build system, such as [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (or whatever you prefer)

## Deliverables
Please send us instructions on how to set up up the project and a ZIP of all necessary files. If you are coming in for an in-person interview after completing this exercise, please have it running on your laptop when you come in.
